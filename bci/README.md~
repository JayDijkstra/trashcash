# MT-BCI03-1---TrashCash
TrashCash is a trashcan that motivates people to throw their garbage into the can. Garbage will be implemented with special and cheap RFID wires so it can be scanned by the scanner (implemented in the Can). People gets a special code to redeem on their personal TrashCash account. The more garbage you throw away, the more value you can get from the can!
